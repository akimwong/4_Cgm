### 1. Excel to MongoDB Data Pipeline

<b>Short name:</b> Excel_Pipeline </p>
<b>Role:</b> Data Engineer </p>
<b>Technologies:</b> R, MongoDB, Excel </p>
<b>Tags:</b> Data Extraction, NoSQL Database Creation </p>
<b>Key Tools:</b> Jupyter Notebooks-R, MongoDB Compass, Microsoft Excel </p>
<b>Description:</b> Developed an automated data pipeline system that transforms a collaborative Excel file (70 columns Ã— 1500 rows, managing 300 mini projects) into a structured MongoDB database. The solution orchestrates data input from 12 different users, ensuring seamless tracking of changes and process flow across multiple stages.

This foundational database structure sets the groundwork for future implementations of real-time tracking, historical data analysis, and automated notifications. The MongoDB architecture enables the development of features for data-driven decision making, efficient team coordination through automated task handovers, and comprehensive performance metrics.
