### 1. Excel to MongoDB Data Pipeline

<b>Short name:</b> Excel_Pipeline </p>
<b>Role:</b> Data Engineer </p>
<b>Technologies:</b> R, MongoDB, Excel </p>
<b>Tags:</b> Data Extraction, NoSQL Database </p>
<b>Key Tools:</b> Jupyter Notebooks-R, MongoDB Compass, Microsoft Excel </p>
<b>Description:</b> Developed a R script that extracts information from a large collaborative Excel file (around 70 columns Ã— 1500 rows, to manage approximately 350 mini projects) and loads it into a structured MongoDB database. The solution maps and transforms data input from around 12 users, maintaining the relationships between data and preserving the process flow structure across multiple stages.

This foundational script sets the groundwork for future implementations:

- Automated data extraction from Excel to MongoDB
- Historical tracking system for all data changes
- Real-time monitoring of process advancement
- Automated notifications for task dependencies
- Performance metrics for task completion times
